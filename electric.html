    <h1>Electric Cars</h1>
    <p>
      An electric car or electric vehicle (EV) is a passenger automobile that is
      propelled by an electric traction motor, using only energy stored in
      on-board batteries. Compared to conventional internal combustion engine
      (ICE) vehicles, electric cars are quieter, more responsive, have superior
      energy conversion efficiency and no exhaust emissions and lower overall
      vehicle emissions[1] (however the power plant supplying the electricity
      might generate its own emissions). The term "electric car" normally refers
      to plug-in electric vehicle, typically a battery electric vehicle (BEV),
      but broadly may also include plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV),
      range-extended electric vehicle (REEV) and fuel cell electric vehicle
      (FCEV). The electric vehicle battery typically needs to be plugged into a
      mains electricity power supply for recharging in order to maximize the
      cruising range. Recharging an electric car can be done at a variety of
      charging stations; these charging stations can be installed in private
      homes, parking garages and public areas.[2] There are also research and
      development in other technologies such as battery swapping and inductive
      charging. As the recharging infrastructures (especially those with fast
      chargers) are still in its relative infancy, range anxiety and time cost
      are frequent psychological obstacles against electric cars during consumer
      purchasing decisions. Worldwide, 10 million plug-in electric cars were
      sold in 2022, a total of 14% of new car sales,[3] up from 9% in 2021. Many
      countries have established government incentives for plug-in electric
      vehicles, tax credits, subsidies, and other non-monetary incentives while
      several countries have legislated to phase-out sales of fossil fuel
      cars,[4][5] to reduce air pollution and limit climate change.[6][7] EVs
      are expected to account for nearly one-fifth of global car sales in 2023,
      according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).[8
